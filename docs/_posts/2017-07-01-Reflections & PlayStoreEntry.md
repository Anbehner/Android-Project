### REFLECTIONS:

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES

Deciding precisely what to build is hardest part of the conceptual work: establishing the detailed technical requirements, including all the interfaces that the customer requires was another part of the challenge.

We encountered a few technical challenges , the below are a few 

1.The initial challenge we faced was the layout design , the group members had different views on the layout which took us time to decide on one.<br>
2.We also had problems while choosing the versions of Android operating system as there were various options .<br>


BENIFITS AND CHALLENGES AS A TEAM 

Anyone who has achieved any kind of success as a leader or manager can easily cite the contribution of teams to achieving that success. 

1.As we grew more into building the project, we were encouraged to develop independence and do things by ourselves. We got used to pursuing our own goals and agendas. But we always made it a point to bring our individualities together to produce the result.<br>
2.Bringing the team together was another big challenge .Teams achieve more when all of the members are fully engaged and interested in the outcome.<br>
3.Few conflicts in teams was unavoidable and wasn't necessarily a bad thing.We learnt that the key is to make conflict productive rather than destructive.<br> 
4.It is important the entire team has clarity on what needs to be achieved and why it is so important.<br>
5.The diversity to innovate ideas and create solutions which would not be possible without the combined skills and experiences of the team.<br>

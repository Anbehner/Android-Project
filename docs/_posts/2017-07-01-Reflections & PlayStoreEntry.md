Welcome to our final blog, hope you enjoyed our blogs!!. As this is our final blog we would like to specify on our reflections about this project and  also you can find the simulated play store entry for our application.

### REFLECTIONS:

#### Technical Difficulties

Deciding precisely what to build is the hardest part of the conceptual work.Establishing the detailed technical requirements, including all the interfaces that the customer requires was another part of the challenge we encountered while doing this project.<br>

We encountered  few technical challenges during this process and below are the few challenges we faced while developing this application: 

1.The initial challenge we faced was the layout design , the group members had different views on the layout which took us time to decide on one.<br>
2.We also had problems while choosing the versions of Android operating system as there were various options .<br>


#### Benifits And Challenges as a Team

Anyone who has achieved any kind of success as a leader or manager can easily cite the contribution of teams to achieving that success. 

1.As we grew more into building the project, we were encouraged to develop independence and do things by ourselves. We got used to pursuing our own goals and agendas. But we always made it a point to bring our individualities together to produce the result.<br>
2.Bringing the team together was another big challenge .Teams achieve more when all of the members are fully engaged and interested in the outcome.<br>
3.Few conflicts in team was unavoidable and wasn't necessarily a bad thing.We learnt that the key is to make conflict productive rather than destructive.<br> 
4.It is important that the entire team has clarity on what needs to be achieved and why it is so important.<br>
5.The diversity to innovate ideas and create solutions which would not be possible without the combined skills and experiences of the team.<br>


#### About the Course

The course helped us to get a detailed analysis on how an Android project works .The entire cycle of software development was explained and it helped us not only understand but manage the working of the entire project .The project given to us was helpful which can be used to solve a real world problem and we are very proud that we contributed for that.It also helped us to work as a team , to manage the downfalls and to appreciate the sucess.  

### Play Store Entry Simulation:

This is how our Money Tracker Application looks like in Google Play store Platform.

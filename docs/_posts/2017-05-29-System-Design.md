# System Design

Hello Everyone! :)
Welcome to our third blog, hope you enjoyed our second blog!!    Over the past few weeks we have been working out on our project with respect to the System Design. With respect to all the user stories which we have mentioned in our previous blog, we have come up with the following Interaction Diagrams and Class Diagrams which would help you all understand our project in a better way. We Shall be discussing about the Development strategies as well.

## Interaction Diagrams

The purpose of the Interaction Diagram is 
1. To capture the dynamic behaviour of the system
2. To describe the message flow in the system
3. To describe the structural organization of the objects 
4. To describe the interaction among objects

Keeping all the above points into consideration, we have come up with the below Sequence Diagrams for two of the user stories.

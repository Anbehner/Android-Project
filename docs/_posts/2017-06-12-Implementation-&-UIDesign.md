Hello Everyone!
Welcome to our fourth blog, hope you enjoyed our third blog!!.    In this blog we shall be discussing about Coding Conventions, Context of use , Mockup of the application and also various Design solutions.

## Mock up for HACKSLASH

After we met the customer and after a detailed discussion about the requirements and the functionalities, we came up with a design of our application HACKSLASH. We sat together and decided a common design in a form of a paper prototype.

We have come up with the following Paper Prototypes for our application.

*The below activity would redirect to show enabling of the Passcode/PIN if and only if he wants to enable the security PIN to use this application 

![Prototype1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/prototype1.png "Login Action"){:height="500px" width="1024px"}

*The below activity would redirect to the Income activity where the user would input his income based on date, category and also the payment method.

![Prototype2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/prototype2.png "Income Activity"){:height="500px" width="1024px"}

*The below activity would redirect to the Expense activity where the user would input his expenditures based on date, category and also the payment method.

![Prototype3]({{site.baseurl}}/images/prototype3.png "Expense Activity"){:height="500px" width="1024px"}

## Story Board for two user stories

Storyboards are similar to scenarios: They illustrate the interaction required to achieve a goal. But instead of using a list of steps, a storyboard visualises the interaction similar to a comic strip. Here is a sample board I created to explore another interaction for our new application:

*The below storyboard describes how the persona Mary keeps a track of the money she spent during her birthday. She takes her friends for a dinner at the VAPIANO. The board consists of a series of frames. Each frame shows sample data. Underneath it, I added a brief description of what Mary does at each step.
![Storyboard1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/storyboard1.png "Adding Expense"){:height="600px" width="1024px"}
Once the above fields are completed she then clicks on “Add Expense” and then this information is stored.

*The below storyboard describes how the persona Sunil secures his HACKSLASH application so that only he would be able to view how he manages his income or expenses. Underneath it, I added a brief description of what Sunil does at each step. 
![Storyboard2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/storyboard2.png "Adding Expense"){:height="600px" width="1024px"}

## User Interface

Following two screens would be the user interface of our application:

*The Home Screen

![HomeScreen]({{site.baseurl}}/images/homescreen.png "Home Screen"){:height="400px" width="200px"}

*The Income Activity Screen

![IncomeScreen]({{site.baseurl}}/images/incomescreen.png "Income Activity Screen"){:height="400px" width="200px"}

## Summary of Changes 

We have been following our initial plan to make sure that we accomplish  all the user requirements which we proposed.

That is all for now !
